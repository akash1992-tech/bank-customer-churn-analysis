## 🎯 Assignment Objectives
Analyze customer behavior and churn factors using **Pivot Tables** and **Data Analysis ToolPak** in Excel.

### ✅ Analytical Questions (Pivot Table)
1. Average credit score by geography.
2. Average account balance by gender within each country.
3. Distribution of active vs. non-active members based on credit card ownership.
4. Customer churn rate per number of products used.
5. Average credit score of churned vs. stayed customers across tenure levels.

### ✅ Research Questions (Data Analysis ToolPak - t-test / ANOVA)
1. Is there a significant difference in average salary between churned and not-churned customers?
2. Is there a significant difference in average credit scores among geographic locations?
